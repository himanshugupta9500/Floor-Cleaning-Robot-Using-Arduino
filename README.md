# Floor-Cleaning-Robot-Using-Arduino
In a present-day scenario, we all are so busy with our work that we don't have the time for cleaning our house properly. The solution to the problem is very simple, you just need to buy a domestic vacuum cleaner robot which will clean your house with the press of a button. But such commercial products share one common issue, which is cost. So today, I decided to make a simple Floor cleaner robot, which is not only simple to make but costs very less compared to commercial products available in the market.
